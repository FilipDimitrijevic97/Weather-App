# Weather-App

:cloud: Weather App is a simple weather app that shows the weather of your current location. It uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the weather data.

## About the project
This project was made for personal use. I wanted to learn how to use the OpenWeatherMap API and how to use the [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) to get the user's location. 

## How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Go to `localhost:1234` in your browser

## Python version
This is my first project in Python. I'm still learning the language, so I'm sure there are a lot of things that can be improved. If you have any suggestions, please let me know!
